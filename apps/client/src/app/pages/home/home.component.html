  NearestStars.com was created in 2018 to serve the purpose of both educating the public about our Solar neighborhood,
  as well as be a center for the latest research on all sorts of stars, from huge blue giants, to freezing rogue planets
  lurking in between the stars.
</p>
<p>
  In its current state, the site is still under construction to arrive at our primary goal at listing the 100 nearest star
  systems to the Sun, so content may change significantly.
</p>
<p>
  Stay tuned, and thanks for visiting the site!
